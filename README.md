# Description
IOS app using React Native that shows the panels with the schedules of each terminal of the MBTA.
This idea is the product of a hack weekend where I built an web app with a retro look that shows the train schedules using fake data with ReactJS and Ruby on Rails ([link](https://github.com/ledes/Departure-Board-Feed)).

Work in Progress...
